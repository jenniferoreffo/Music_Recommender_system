This is a project within the ALX curriculum aimed at assessing our proficiency in website development. Jennifer is the primary contributor to this endeavor.

The objective of this project is to create a simplistic music recommendation system. It involves the retrieval of song recommendations based on user-inputted songs, considering various factors such as acousticness, danceability, duration, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, loudness, speechiness, tempo, and valence.

Utilizing these factors, the system will leverage Spotify's API to automate the recommendation process. The recommended songs will then be displayed on the website interface.

To run the project, execute the command "Python3 app.py".
